### `load` 和 `Initialize` 的区别?

###  initialize

```objective-c
Summary

Initializes the class before it receives its first message.
Declaration

+ (void)initialize;
Discussion

The runtime sends initialize to each class in a program just before the class, or any class that inherits from it, is sent its first message from within the program. Superclasses receive this message before their subclasses.
The runtime sends the initialize message to classes in a thread-safe manner. That is, initialize is run by the first thread to send a message to a class, and any other thread that tries to send a message to that class will block until initialize completes.
The superclass implementation may be called multiple times if subclasses do not implement initialize—the runtime will call the inherited implementation—or if subclasses explicitly call [super initialize]. If you want to protect yourself from being run multiple times, you can structure your implementation along these lines:
+ (void)initialize {
  if (self == [ClassName self]) {
    // ... do the initialization ...
  }
}
Because initialize is called in a blocking manner, it’s important to limit method implementations to the minimum amount of work necessary possible. Specifically, any code that takes locks that might be required by other classes in their initialize methods is liable to lead to deadlocks. Therefore, you should not rely on initialize for complex initialization, and should instead limit it to straightforward, class local initialization.

```



### load

```objective-c
Summary

Invoked whenever a class or category is added to the Objective-C runtime; implement this method to perform class-specific behavior upon loading.
Declaration

+ (void)load;
Discussion

The load message is sent to classes and categories that are both dynamically loaded and statically linked, but only if the newly loaded class or category implements a method that can respond.
The order of initialization is as follows:
All initializers in any framework you link to.
All +load methods in your image.
All C++ static initializers and C/C++ __attribute__(constructor) functions in your image.
All initializers in frameworks that link to you.
In addition:
A class’s +load method is called after all of its superclasses’ +load methods.
A category +load method is called after the class’s own +load method.
In a custom implementation of load you can therefore safely message other unrelated classes from the same image, but any load methods implemented by those classes may not have run yet.
Important
Custom implementations of the load method for Swift classes bridged to Objective-C are not called automatically.
```



- `+ initialize` 方法：苹果官方对这个方法有这样的一段描述：这个方法会在 第一次初始化这个类之前 被调用，我们用它来初始化静态变量。
- `load` 方法会在加载类的时候就被调用，也就是应用启动的时候，在调用 `main` 函数之前会加载所有的类，也会调用每个类的 `load` 方法。
- `initialize` 方法类似一个懒加载，如果没有使用这个类，那么系统默认不会去调用这个方法，且默认只加载一次；
- `initialize` 的调用发生在 `+init` 方法之前，创建子类的时候，子类会去调用父类的 `initialize` 方法。
